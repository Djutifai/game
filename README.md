# testRogue
### Hello! I'm here just trying to build-up my first rogue-like game, using windows console. I have few goals before I will transfer all things from this project to another with different library. 

- [x] Combat system
- [x] AI
- [ ] Interactive objects (chests, doors, stairs etc.)
 - [x] Chests
 - [x] Doors
 - [ ] Stairs
- [ ] Procedural generation of a dungeon (Semi-done)
 
##### There might be some new goals, but all of the big stuff will be started and finished in a project that I already mentioned before.
