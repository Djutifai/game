### Hello! Im here just trying to build-up my first rogue-like game, using windows console. I have few goals before I will transfer all things from this project to another that is using custom-made library. 

- [x] Combat system
- [ ] AI 
- [ ] Interactive objects (chests, doors, stairs etc.) 
- [ ] Procedural generation of a dungeon

##### There might be some new goals, but all of the big stuff will be started and finished in a project that I already mentioned before.
